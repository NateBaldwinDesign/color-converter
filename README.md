Color converter using d3.js

## Why another converter?
I got sick of looking at different sites for different converters... one place for Lab conversion, another for HSL, and another for HSLuv. Also, no converter for CIECAM02.

But all these exist in the [D3-color](https://github.com/d3/d3-color) library, along with various D3-color plugins.

So now they all have a home.
